## What is this App? Who is it for?

Families with kids need a simple way to let each other know where everybody is and when they can expect to be back home.  Our project provides a simple, interactive way for kids and parents to quickly share their plans in a dedicated space.  In the user interface, a family member chooses from a customizable list of destinations, selects who is going with them, and provides an estimated return time.  The status of each member of the family is displayed visually on the app.  A visual indication is given if the estimated return time elapses and the family member hasn't updated their status as being home.
